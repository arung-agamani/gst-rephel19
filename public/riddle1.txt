It is 6 o'clock or so I think
I can only know from the sun

Last night was our first land
After a few months of salt and tides
I almost forgot how this barren green felt

Nightmare came to wake me up
This foreign feeling
I thought I sunk into the sea
My back feels like I am on a beach
Washed by the waves that come occasionally

What is it called?
I don't remember

Doesn't it take 3 breath?
I don't know

All I know is it needs 10 spaces

Do you know what is it?

Hint : It's morning and He is on "barren green land"
