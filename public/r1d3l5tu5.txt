Something is ringing in my head
It wasn't about the girl i met yesterday.
Something is telling me that it's all about your bond.
What bond?
What kind of bond?
No, this is not some chemistry stuff.
"Don't cheat. Play like a real gentleman. Be fair."

What the heck?!
What is this?
It tells me to grab a paper and a pen.
And then it gives me lots random words...

I was not prepared that time.
I missed the first two words, but i managed to write down the rest of it.

Pen. Rum. Time. Useful. Wind. Dust. Umbra.  Heist. Purpose. Opening. Film. Upside. Yoghurt. Occurences. Alphaca. Yeast. Enigma. Wonderland. Yam. Teapot. Yankee. Homeland. Super. Simplification. Embrace. Boy. Yield. Yarn. Moon. Air. Moisture. Toppings.

After that I can only hear some high pitched ringing noises.
And then it slowly fades.
Then it appears again.
"Game...."

I honestly have no idea.
Help.
Someone help.


Hint :
A movie about treasure hunt once portrays the famous subtitution cipher.
Find the key first.
