- Hosted at awoo.genshiken-itb.org

## What's this?
This repository contains the source code used for Rephel riddle in Genshiken Staff Training 2019

Several files are not directly linked to the index.js file in this repository, so I'll leave that for the reader to figure out.

## Stage 4
That statue is moving, and tries to tell a story?

Answer : West South East North

And there goes.... [Array]
A bag of word, huh?
[Note] : One of the usage of array is to act as a bag of word.
### Source code explanation
> function b() takes string input which predetermined from RANDOM selection of phrases or words, with RANDOM string assigned to it.
> Taking the answer from the direction which the statue had pointed, you can tell that West South East North can be abbreviated into WSEN
>> "You're thinking that this thing gonna just be like that, eh? Not that fast, alfonso."
> "North" often thought as "forward", or "go up", in this case, "ascension". Replace the last letter in WSEN into A so you get WSEA
> AS you notice from the source code in index.js, it takes the first letter of every item to make a string, and compare it with "wsea".
> If you're right, then.....yay congrats.
> If not, then jump from the plank, ay.

## Stage 5
